You attempt to make friends with the dinosaurs, offering them samples of the plants from your lab. To your surprise, they seem to enjoy the treats and let you tag along with them as they roam the jungle. After a few days, you use your time-travel device to return home, feeling exhilarated and a little bit crazy.
